# Get the coffee!

Get the coffee is a free multiplayer game developed by 2 CITM students where you will fight against other cafeine adicts in order to collect more coffee every few seconds and not die, you can use your stored cafeine to use incredible powers such as a quick but effective dash, a strong pull on your oponents stoping them in their tracks or you can build up your rage to destroy some walls to get more and more coffee. The game has 2 maps wich will rotate randomly every match.

## Rules

The rules are simple:

- The game goes on based on rounds, you have to win 3 to wim the game itself.
- You can see the round timer on the bottom left corner of your screen.
- You have a personal timer in the upper center of your screen, don't let it get to 0 or you will die.
- You also have a bar above your head reminding you your timer but with colors.
- You can refill said timer drinking coffee wich spawns in separate points of the map.
- You can challenge up to 4 players but there won't be 4 coffees at the same time, the number of coffees on the map equals the players -1 ignoring the first spawned coffee wich is unique and always in the middle.
- Every skill (Dash,Pull and Break) have diferent cooldowns, use each skill wisely to take the advantage.

## Controls

- Use "W,A,S,D"to move around the map.
- Use "SPACE BAR" to activate a quick speed multiplier or dash, meaning that this dash is not unidirectonal and you can control it.
- Use "P" to pull an oponent stuning them for half a second.
- Use "O" to break a wall of the map, keep in mind that it will remain broken until next round for all players.
